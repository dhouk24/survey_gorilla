survey_gorilla
==============

This is a basic clone of Survey Monkey built as a team project one day at Dev Bootcamp. It addresses the three main facets of surveys, letting you create multiple questions with multiple options, send out the survey, and view results in a graphical format. There is plenty of room for improvement in the code, but it serves to show the progression of my abilities over time.
